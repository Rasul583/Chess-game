    <h1>Work in progress</h1>
    <p>The game isn't finished yet so until the game is finished this is going to be more of a updates tab. Once the game is finished, the download for it will be here and hopefully,
        at some point it will be playble here on browsers as well.

    <h1>Updates:</h1>
    <p>05/03/2021: Pawn can now be moved by clicking and draging them to a square. I'm thinking about making it so that you can also move pieces by clicking on them 
        and clicking the square you want to move them to and having a toggle to let the player chose which controls they prefer. But right now I need to fix some bugs 
        such as the pawn being dropped when the mouse moves too quickly and also make it so that each piece moves the way they are supposed to move. 
        I.e. make the knight only move in L shapes, make the bishops only move diagonally, etc.</p>
